### bokehmol, gotta plot them mol!
[bokehmol](https://github.com/cbouy/bokehmol) provides custom extensions that help plotting molecules with the Bokeh library.

It currently provides hover tools that can depict molecules on-the-fly using SMILES: no need to pre-generate the depictions and store them in memory anymore! Everything is rendered client-side in the browser so you don't even need to install rdkit in your Python environment.

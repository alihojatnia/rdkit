### RDKit
RDKit is a cheminformatics library that is widely used in the field of computational chemistry. It provides a wide range of tools for working with chemical data such as molecular representation, data mining, and machine learning. The library is open-source, allowing researchers and developers to freely access and use its features.

### bokehmol, gotta plot them mol!
[bokehmol](https://github.com/cbouy/bokehmol) provides custom extensions that help plotting molecules with the Bokeh library.

It currently provides hover tools that can depict molecules on-the-fly using SMILES: no need to pre-generate the depictions and store them in memory anymore! Everything is rendered client-side in the browser so you don't even need to install rdkit in your Python environment.

### Global-Chem
[Global Chem](https://globalchem.gitbook.io/globalchem-your-chemical-graph-network/) is a public dictionary of common chemical lists using the Common Chemical Name as input and SMILES/SMARTS as output organized by their respective community in a knowledge graph.[github](https://github.com/Global-Chem/global-chem)
